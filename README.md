# DSA Notebook

Welcome to my personal **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** notebook. This repository serves as a knowledge base where I document my solutions, optimized approaches, and key learnings from LeetCode/Gfg problems.

The goal is not just to store code, but to explain the *intuition* behind every solution for future revision.

## 📂 Repository Structure

The repository is organized by **Topic** first, followed by **Difficulty Level**, and finally the **Problem** itself. This makes it easy to focus revision on specific weak areas
